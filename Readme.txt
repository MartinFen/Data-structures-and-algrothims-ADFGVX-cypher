Encryption.
The Encryption is working and in good time.

Coloumn Transposition.
I had trouble with getting the program to do the coloumn transposition,
so there is no sorting algrothim in the program for it.

Decryption.
I could not get the decryption to decrypt code in the way i wanted, 
I had to do a cheat method to do the encryption.

To Run the file.

All files are included i have renamed the War and Peace file to WarAndPeace.txt it is in the zip flie.

1. Just run the program and enter the user pasword.
2. The program will encrytpt the file and write it to a file in the folder called encrypted.txt 
3. it will then decrypt it then write the decrypted code to a file called decrypt.txt it will be in upper case.
